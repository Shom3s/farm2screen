## 1.0 Project Overview

The Farm2screen is an innovative online marketplace designed to transform how farmers market and sell their pineapples directly to consumers, wholesalers, and businesses. Aligning with the project’s vision to transform the way people connect, shop and grow businesses online, the platform provides a convenient, trustworthy, and personalized e-commerce experience for both farmers and buyers.

At its core, the platform empowers pineapple farmers by giving them the tools to list, promote, and manage their products online without relying on middlemen. The platform aims to support real-time pricing, streamline order management, and provide broader market exposure through increased online visibility and enable farmers to expand their customer base and boost sales.
