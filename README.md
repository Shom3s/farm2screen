1.0 Project Overview

The Farm2screen is an innovative online marketplace designed to transform how farmers market and sell their pineapples directly to consumers, wholesalers, and businesses. Aligning with the project’s vision to transform the way people connect, shop and grow businesses online, the platform provides a convenient, trustworthy, and personalized e-commerce experience for both farmers and buyers.

At its core, the platform empowers pineapple farmers by giving them the tools to list, promote, and manage their products online without relying on middlemen.
